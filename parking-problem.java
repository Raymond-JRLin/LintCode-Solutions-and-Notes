// 1552. Parking Problem
// Description
// Ming went out to buy a drink at noon. On the way to the trash can, he passed a public parking lot. Because of the programmer's professional habits, he would like to know how much the parking lot is maximizing utilization in the morning.
// After communicating with the uncle of the guard, he obtained a record of the vehicle arrival time and playing time of the parking lot in the morning (data format reference sample input).
// Can you write a function through the data you get to help Ming calculate this parking lot. How many cars are parked at the same time in the morning?
//
// For convenience, simplify the calculation, the entry time and the opening time to record on the whole point, such as 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock.
// If the admission time in the parking record is later than the playing time, the parking record is considered invalid, such as [7,3]
// Assume that if more than one car enters the market at the same time, the exit vehicle is preferred.
// The number of parking records does not exceed 100,000100,000, and the time does not exceed 1e91e9
// Have you met this question in a real interview?
// Example
// Given a = [[8,9],[4,6],[3,7],[6,8]], return 2.
//
// Explanation:
// There are 2 cars in the parking lot at [4, 6] or [6, 7],
// and at most 1 car in the rest of the time.`
// Given a = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]] , return 1ã€‚
//
// Explanation:
// Whenever one car is driven out, another car comes in again, up to one car.
